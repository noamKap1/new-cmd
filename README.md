# new-cmd

In this project, I created a new version of the command line interpreter.
In this version, you can write like its the regular cmd, moreover, you can:
1. create a new command from other commands and their inputs.
2. create a new command from 2 other commands.
3. show all the new commands.
4. delete and change the names of the new commands.
